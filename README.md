- I’m interested in many, many, MANY things
- I’m currently learning godot, game design, cyber security/penetration testing, linux distro building, and the ocarina
- I’m looking to collaborate on things
- How to reach me: feliflitzberg@proton.me
- Pronouns: baphomet takes any pronouns
- Fun fact: ocarinas are easier to play than recorders, and can be mastered more easily than recorders as well
